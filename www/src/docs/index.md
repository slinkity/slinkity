## Technologies used

Slinkity stands on the shoulders of giants. You can think of Slinkity as the "glue" binding 2 tools together:

1. [**Eleventy:**](https://www.11ty.dev) a static site generator with a rich feature set for fetching data, composing layouts, and inserting content with "shortcodes."
2. [**Vite:**](https://vitejs.dev) a bundler that takes the boilerplate out of your set up. It'll compile JS component frameworks, handle CSS preprocessors with little-to-no config (say, SCSS and PostCSS), and show dev changes on-the-fly using [hot module replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).
